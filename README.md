# Firebase xcframework integration with SPM

A small mirror for https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk, to add support for using their binary dependencies (xcframeworks) with swift package manager. 

This repo contains a [Package.swift](https://github.com/akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks/blob/master/Package.swift) file, which uses a `binaryTarget` for all Firebase libraries (xcframework files are hosted in github [releases](https://github.com/akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks/releases)). 

## Official SPM Support

Firebase currently supports SPM integration, see the [official SDK integration instructions](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk#installation). This repo is an alternative for integrating with their pre-built xcframeworks for faster build times. See in depth discussion for official SPM support for xcframeworks [here](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/6564).

# Installation

```
// swift-tools-version:5.3
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyLibrary",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v11)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MyLibrary",
            targets: ["MyLibraryTarget"]
        )
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            name: "Firebase",
            url: "https://github.com/akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks.git",
            .exact("8.10.0")
        ),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyLibraryTarget",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Google-Mobile-Ads-SDK", package: "Firebase"),
                .product(name: "FirebaseAnalytics", package: "Firebase")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

# How it works

The `Package.swift` and `Sources` files are automatically generated via a [script](https://github.com/akaffenberger/firebase-ios-sdk-xcframeworks/blob/master/.scripts/package.sh), which is set to run in a scheduled cron job via Github Actions. 

The script performs the following actions:
- Downloads the latest release from https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
- Parses the Firebase.zip to generate Package.swift and Sources/
- Commits changes on a new branch and creates a PR
- Creates a draft release, with a tag that mirrors the Firebase release. The draft release includes the assets needed for the swift package
